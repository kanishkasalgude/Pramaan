# 07 · Availability Matrix: What We Can Actually Use (and the Fallback for Each)

> Many of Cloudinary's most relevant features are Beta, on-request, or Enterprise. Designing around something you can't enable is a common hackathon failure. This matrix says, for every capability in our design, **whether we can use it on Free**, **how to unlock it**, and **the fallback if we can't**.

Legend: ✅ Free, self-serve · 🟡 add-on free tier (quota) · 🔶 Beta, self-serve · 📨 Beta/feature **on request** (support ticket) · 🔒 paid/Enterprise

## Support tickets to file on Day 0 (support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)

1. **"Hackathon (Code Cubicle 6.0 × Cloudinary Challenge): request beta access to Content Provenance & Authenticity (C2PA / `fl_c2pa`) for cloud `<cloud_name>`."** Explain the use case: verifiable NGO impact evidence.
2. **"Request beta access to Duplicate Image Detection add-on"**: use case: detecting recycled field photos across projects.
3. Ask via the **Cloudinary Creators Discord** and DevRel whether hackathon teams can get a temporary **credit / add-on quota boost** or a Moderation advanced trial.

> Even if these arrive after the deadline, the architecture treats them as **pluggable signal providers**. Show the adapters in code and say "enabled when granted". Judges reward teams that understand the platform's roadmap.
