## Method
- **Primary sources:** HackCulture page (rendered in a browser, incl. FAQs), the PS PDF (a single image, transcribed), Cloudinary's hackathon page and submission form, Cloudinary docs as markdown (~60 pages), release-note RSS feeds (2024–2026), npm tarballs of both starter kits, the `cloudinary-devs/skills` and `create-cloudinary-next-template` repos, and the MCP/SDK npm packages (tool inventories).
- **Secondary sources:** past-winner write-ups (Devpost), Cloudinary DevRel articles, Indian government/CSR/DPDP coverage, global impact-credibility investigations.
- **Verification:** claims about Cloudinary features cite their docs; availability (Free/beta/Enterprise) was checked per feature. Items that could not be verified are listed in `06_references/sources.md` §H. Syntax that should be tested live is marked **(verify)**.
